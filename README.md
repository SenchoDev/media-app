Responsive Movie Application where you can search over 1 000 000 movies and TV shows.

## Description
This app is fully designed, coded and structured by me.
I designed it in Adobe XD [adobe.com](https://xd.adobe.com/view/cdd1cfbf-5c4f-4fa1-7c95-dfca2c9d8ea9-bbe0/) **<--LINK of design**
I've built whole website with HTML5 & CSS3, implemeted main functionalites with MVC Pattern, but then i realised, it started to get bit complicated to manage multiple files(HTML, JS) without a framework. 
So I started learning React/Redux.

### Note
- Everything works just fine but some features are not fully finished. 


### Built with
- Webpack
- Babel
- HTML5 and SASS
- Vanilla JS
- JavaScript MVC Pattern
